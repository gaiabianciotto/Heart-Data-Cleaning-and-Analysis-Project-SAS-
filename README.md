# Heart Data Cleaning and Analysis Project (SAS)

## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and frequency analysis on the `heart.xlsx` dataset using SAS. It focuses on transforming variables, filtering rows, and summarizing relationships between clinical indicators and smoking habits.

## Features
- Reads data from Excel using SAS `xlsx` engine
- Cleans dataset by removing specific variables
- Filters for relevant clinical observations
- Engineers a new categorical variable: `smokingStatus`
- Generates a two-way frequency table of `ageCHDDiag` vs. `smokingStatus`

## Project Files
- `sas_code/heart_analysis.sas`: Main SAS program
- `data/heart_sample.xlsx`: Sample input file (if shareable)
- `output/freq_table_output.txt`: Output from frequency table (optional)

## Requirements
- Base SAS with XLSX engine enabled
- Excel file structured with patient cardiovascular data
